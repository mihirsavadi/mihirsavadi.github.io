# Where's Blue? 
# (STATUS: installed, transmitting)

Here you shall find the most recently updated location of Blue my Honda Fit. Click the Pin in the map below to see more information - date and time of location snapshot, GPS coordinates, etc.  

Blue should be able to continuously transmit her location as long as her engine is running. She can continue to transmit for a few days without cranking, until her transmitter's battery dies.

* Dallas TX to El Paso TX | 14May to 15May | 9hr 6min

#### OptionA: 2 days
