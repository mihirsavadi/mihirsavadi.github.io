# Where's Blue? 
# (STATUS: battery failure, not transmitting)

Note:  
GPS Tracker's auxiliary battery and charging circuit seems to have failed, right on the first day of the trip - very annoying. Can't open it up and fix it until I reach California, so no more tracking :,(

Here you shall find the most recently updated location of Blue my Honda Fit. Click the Pin in the map below to see more information - date and time of location snapshot, GPS coordinates, etc.  

Blue should be able to continuously transmit her location as long as her engine is running. She can continue to transmit for a few days without cranking, until her transmitter's battery dies.

My intended route is as follows:  

* Blacksburg VA to NashVille TN | 12May to 13May | 6hr 18min
  * HOTEL [booked] | Days Inn by Wyndham Goodlettsville/Nashville

* Nashville TN to Dallas TX | 13May to 14May | 9hr 53min
  * HOTEL [booked] | La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Dallas I-35 Walnut Hill Ln  

* Dallas TX to El Paso TX | 14May to 15May | 9hr 6min
  * HOTEL [booked] | La Quinta Inn by Wyndham El Paso West  

* El Paso TX to San Diego CA | 15May to 16May | 10hr 13min
  * Destination! | 2865 Lincoln Avenue, Upstairs Flat, San Diego, CA 92104

[***KEY***] [A to B (Stay at B)] | [FIRST DAY: travel and overnight SECOND DAY: Checkout and leave early morn] | [Drive hours according to google maps]
