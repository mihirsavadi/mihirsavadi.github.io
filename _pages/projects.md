# Formula SAE | VT Motorsports
<div markdown="1" style="font-size:20px; font-family: Times New Roman">
[Formula SAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE) is an international collegiate design competition where a team of students fund, build, manage, and operate high performance race-vehicles from scratch - in our case both Electric and Combustion Powertrain vehicles. We typically have design cycles of around 1 year (barring the COVID era), with competitions in Brooklyn, Michigan and Fontana, California. Teams attend from all accross the United States, as well as Europe and Asia. The projects posted at the linked github repository are [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level) descriptions in order to protect pre-season competitiveness of in-house designs. As a team we are composed of a wide variety of majors both in and out of engineering, however this page will only cover electrical related projects I was involved with - which is only a small portion of the many amazing things the team accomplishes every year. Check us out at [www.vtmotorsports.com](http://vtmotorsports.weebly.com/).
