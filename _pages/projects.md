<!-- Put project write ups and summaries here - try to get drone stuff, and also
scan thru various classes for interesting project writeups - e.g. the audio
direction finding project - add othre stuff like the useful link andy sent. Dont
include any of these as blog posts.  -->

Projects are split accordingly:

**[Formula SAE | VT Motorsports]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/fsae)**
[Formula SAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE) is an international collegiate design competition where a team of students fund, build, manage, and operate high performance race-vehicles from scratch - in our case both Electric and Combustion Powertrain vehicles. We typically have design cycles of around 1 year (barring the COVID era), with competitions in Brooklyn, Michigan and Fontana, California. Teams attend from all accross the United States, as well as Europe and Asia. There are stringent rules and regulations to adhere to. It really is kind of like a mini FIA-Formula One series in many ways. The projects posted here are [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level) descriptions in order to protect pre-season competitiveness of in-house designs. As a team we are composed of a wide variety of majors both in and out of engineering, however this page will only cover electrical related projects I was involved with - which is only a small portion of the many amazing things the team accomplishes every year. Check us out at [www.vtmotorsports.com](http://www.vtmotorsports.com/).

**[Glidio]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/glidio)**
Glidio aims to help lower the barriers to entry into hang-gliding and other non-powered glider sports by bringing to market affordable, scalable, and thoughtfully designed Variometers.

**[Miscellaneous]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/misc)**
Here you will find many of my other projects from past years, documented around the best of personal archive remains and github-pages repository space limitations.
