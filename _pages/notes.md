Over the years I have compiled notes for *some* of the various classes or courses I have
been in. I try to keep layout and language simple, candid, and intuitive. As far as I have been told, people have found them useful. I upload and share them whenever I can, but managing several google drive shared links can only go so far before becoming a pain. This is a nice upgrade.

If you notice any mistakes, or would like to inquire about other course materials, [shoot me an email](mailto:mihirsavadi1@vt.edu). I'll try to help where I can.

## International Baccalaureate (IB)
<div markdown="1" style="font-size:18px">
Below are some of my surviving IB notes from the ancient paper & pencil times of 2014-2015, as well as other interesting literature I came up with for various course requirements.

[Physics (Higher Level) - All Notes](assets\notes\IBnotes\HLPhysicsNotes_optionEmedPhysicsNotPresent.pdf) <br/>
Out of the three higher level subjects I had undertaken (Math, Physics, Economics), physics was personally the most satisfying. The electrical portions of the course partially influenced my future inclinations towards Electrical & Computer Engineering (in addition to the Physics Extended Essay + many hours of messing about with an Arduino Uno).

[Physics Extended Essay (EE) <br/> (*on electromagnetics and magnetic linear accelerators*)](assets\notes\IBnotes\extendedEssayFinal.pdf) <br/>
The extended essay is a sort of mini-thesis on any relevant topic within a chosen subject, and was a requirement for the IB program. Mine was quite ambitious (and I paid for it in extraneous man-hours) but it was incredibly fun.

[Math Exploration <br/> (*on underwater light refraction*)](assets\notes\IBnotes\MathExplorationFinal.pdf) <br/>
The math exploration allowed Higher & Standard Level students to explore any topic, whilst being assessed on mathematical rigor and communication. My run at it turned out to be more of a physics derivation as opposed to an actual pure mathematics 'exploration'. It was a fun endeavor nonetheless - I was into Scuba Diving at the time so it was contextually relevant.

[Theory of Knowledge Final Essay](assets\notes\IBnotes\TOK_finalEssay.pdf) <br/>
[Theory of Knowledge Final Presentation](assets\notes\IBnotes\TOK_finalslides.pdf) <br/>
Theory of Knowledge (TOK) was one of the more enigmatic subjects all IB students had to take. The essay and presentation attached above scored well (A) in final IBO assessments. The essay includes a planning flow chart at the end. The presentation has its script at the end as well. Hopefully this is proves somewhat useful as a reference for any current IB students.

[Economics Internal Assessments <br/> [*commentaries on EU carbon tax regulation, Swiss Franc Appreciation, and Australian Interest rates*]](assets\notes\IBnotes\Econs_IAs.pdf) <br/>
There were three Internal Assessments, all of which were short commentaries on timely articles we had to find. I'm only just realizing (at the time of writing this) how Eurocentric the articles I chose were.

[Geography Internal Assessment <br/> [*investigating the gradient and hydraulic radii relationships of a river*]](assets\notes\IBnotes\GeographyIAFinal.pdf) <br/>
The Geography Internal Assessment (IA) was a large project based assessment with a final report-style deliverable. It was a requirement for all IB Geography students - I had taken it at the Standard Level. We had done a trip to Tioman, Malaysia to get ours done, which was quite fun.
